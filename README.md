## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm start` if you want to launch the Socket.io chat server locally
3. Open any `.html` file in your web browser
4. Navigate using the menu to explore all pages

## Live Streaming Setup

The live stream is served from the production endpoints below.

| Format | URL |
|--------|-----|
| HLS    | `https://stream.bwetv.live/hls/bwetv/index.m3u8` |
| DASH   | `https://stream.bwetv.live/dash/bwetv/index.mpd` |

To point players at a different server, update `STREAM_CONFIG.primary.url` in `content.js` and the `<source>` tags in `index.html` and `schedule.html`.

## Chat & Firebase Notes

- The shared live chat UI expects Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database access.
- Protect production chat data with Firebase Security Rules so only allowed users can write and read the collections/paths you expose.
